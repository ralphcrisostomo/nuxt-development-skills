# Git Commit Skill

## Sensitive File Guard

Before staging, scan `git status` for sensitive patterns:

- `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`
- `*.tfstate`, `*.tfvars` (with real values)
- `credentials.json`, `serviceAccountKey.json`, `*secret*`

If a match is found:

1. Append the missing pattern to `.gitignore` and stage `.gitignore`.
2. If already tracked, warn and suggest `git rm --cached <file>`.
3. Never proceed with committing a sensitive file.

## Smart Commit Workflow

### 1. Review & Sensitive File Guard

```bash
git status
git diff
git diff --cached
git log --oneline -5
```

Scan the output against the sensitive patterns above.

### 2. Auto-stage tracked changes

```bash
git add -u
```

Stage tracked modifications and deletions only. Review untracked files first and stage by name if appropriate.

### 3. Analyse for multi-concern splitting

Group changed files by directory or feature area. If changes span unrelated concerns (e.g. a bug fix and a new feature), split into separate commits automatically.

### 4. Generate commit message

- Infer **type**: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `style`.
- Infer **scope** from the primary directory or feature area.
- Subject line: imperative voice, under 72 characters.
- Body (optional): explain "why", not "what".

### 5. Commit via heredoc

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): subject line

Optional body.

Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

Replace `<model>` with the actual model name (e.g. `Opus 4.6`, `Sonnet 4.6`).

### 6. Handle pre-commit hook failure

Fix the issue, re-stage, and create a **new** commit. Never use `--no-verify`. Never amend — the failed commit does not exist.

## Worktree Workflow

When working in a git worktree (`.claude/worktrees/<name>/`):

1. **Smart commit** all changes using the workflow above.
2. **Switch to `main`** in the primary working directory.
3. **Squash-merge**: `git merge --squash <worktree-branch>`.
4. **Commit** the squashed result with a single well-formed message.
5. **Verify**: `git log --oneline -5 && git status`.
6. **Remove**: `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/<name>`.

Commit before merging, always merge into `main`, never delete the branch before merge is confirmed, use `--squash` for linear history.

## Rules

- **Proceed without confirmation** — stage, generate message, and commit in one flow.
- Never commit sensitive files (run the guard first).
- Never amend a published commit — create a new one.
- Never force-push `main`.
- Never use `--no-verify` or `--no-gpg-sign`.
- Prefer named files over `git add -A` to avoid staging secrets or noise.

## Quick Reference

- Sensitive File Guard → `git add -u` → multi-concern split → Conventional Commit via heredoc with `Co-Authored-By`.
- Worktree: commit → squash-merge to main → verify → remove.
